                           Frontier Research’s multidisciplinary team is drawn from a diverse range of professions, including international development, risk management and private equity. What unites us is a long-standing interest in West Africa – and a passion for producing quality research.

                       <p>Since its inception in 2015, Frontier Research has sought to bridge the information gap that exists in Sierra Leone and Liberia, countries where available data often is incomplete, out of date, unreliable or unpublished. In the process, we have executed numerous projects for a range of clients, including the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), GIZ, UNDP and the Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF). </p>

                                      Throughout the recruitment and training of enumerators, survey piloting and management of field deployments, we incorporate strict quality control mechanisms in our research process to ensure the data we collect is trustworthy. We collect data using tablets, which allows our core team to review the data that has been uploaded at the end of each day, and randomly check-in on our field researchers.
